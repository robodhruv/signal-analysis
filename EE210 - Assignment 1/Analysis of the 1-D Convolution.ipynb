    "The convolution operation is a fundamental operation on two functions $f$ and $g$ which produces a third function, that is typically viewed as a modified version of one of the original functions, giving the integral of the pointwise multiplication of the two functions as a function of the amount that one of the original functions is translated. Convolution is similar to _cross-correlation_.\n",

This means that given an LTI system, the complete system can be represented solely by its impulse response $h(t)$. _(Similar definition for discrete-time signals.)_"

Hence, we present an analysis of various ways to compute this convolution by employing certain other beautiful properties of this operation.

    "Impressive, isn't it? Simply vectorizing the code can improve the runtime by a factor of 30! This makes vectorization a very important trick while writing codes involving array multiplication etc. Vectorization becomes difficult and expensive as the size of the matrix increases, as the functions such as inverse are very intensive for very large matrices. Also, storage of matrices of the order of $10^5\\times10^5$ and larger require significant amount of memory, and generally fail to execute by normal function calls. All these restrict the application of the vectorized implementation to small-sized inputs.\n",
